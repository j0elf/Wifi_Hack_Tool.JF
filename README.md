# WebSiteAttack.JF
WebSiteAttack.JF is an application (.exe) designed to take down web pages by creating DDoS attacks that aim to saturate the server by sending messages (pings) to the server until it collapses and remains inaccessible to its users, only the 10% of the time, only if a website is not very secure and weak, you can also notice that the website does not crash but it does go slower.
